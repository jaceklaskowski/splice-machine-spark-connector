# Splice Machine Connector for Apache Spark™

**Splice Machine Connector for Apache Spark™** is a library to allow Apache Spark (namely Spark SQL and Spark Structured Streaming) to work with data in Splice Machine.

The connector *is aimed to* support two different Data Source contracts in Apache Spark:

1. The legacy Data Source V1 API with `spliceV1` format

1. The modern Data Source V2 API with `spliceV2` format

## Status

This library is currently work-in-progress and is likely to get backwards-incompatible updates.

Consult [Issues](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/splice-machine-spark-connector/issues) to know the missing features.
